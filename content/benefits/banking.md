## COAST CAPITAL 

Coast Capital is Canada’s largest credit union by membership, with over 580,000 members and we’re growing. Now that we’re a federal credit union, we have big plans to extend into new markets. Let’s go over some of the details that explain why over half a million people trust our service today.

### YOU GET A SAY
As a credit union, we’re owned by our members. That means we’re accountable to you, and you get a say in how we do things. Every member owns the same amount of shares – no more, no less. Members vote on our Board of Directors, who help make sure your voice is heard.

### YOU’RE A PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER
We’ve made a promise to build a richer future for youth in our communities. Each year, we give 7% of our pre-tax earnings back to the communities where our members live, with a focus on helping youth. 

Coast Capital also recently became a Certified B Corporation®, joining a growing movement of change-makers using business as a force for good. B Corps™ are certified by the nonprofit B Lab® to meet high standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.

### YOU SAVE MONEY
Since we’re accountable to our members, we’re dedicated to doing what’s really best for them. And you know what’s not great? Paying service fees. We were the first full-service financial institution in Canada to introduce a free chequing account. 

Our Free Chequing, Free Debit and More Account® can save you some serious cash that you can use for things that are more important to you – like saving for retirement or that family trip to Hawaii. We’re also able to offer other perks like better interest rates.

### PERSONAL PACKAGE:
* Enjoy free banking with our Free Chequing, Debit and More Account® as well as a complimentary first cheque order
